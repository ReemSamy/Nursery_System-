# Nursery_System

This system is a small nursery management system with an API back-end built using the Node.js framework and the Express.js library. 
It allows the administrator to manage teachers, children, and classes.
Teachers can register and their information is stored in the system.
The administrator can add children to the system, and each child's information is recorded including their name, age, and class level. 
The administrator can also create and manage classes, and assign teachers as supervisors for each class. 
The API includes routes for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting teachers, children, and classes. 
The system also includes middleware for logging requests, handling errors, and managing invalid URLs.
Overall, this system provides a basic framework for managing a small nursery using MVC design pattern
